    "    - Implement a class method called `get_loyalty_points` that returns the current number of loyatly points a customer has.\n",
    "    - Implement a class method called `display_details` to display a customer details in the format specified below the first code cell (keep scrolling!).\n",
    "- Read data from the file `customers.csv` and create a `Customer` object for each customer.  Store these objects in dictionary with the customers' phone numbers as keys.\n",
    "- Read a log of expenditures from `transactions.csv` and use this data to update the loyalty points of customers.  For every transaction, each time a customer spends \\\\$10, they get 1 loyalty point; partial points are lost.  \n",
    "    - For example, if a customer has two transacions, one for \\\\$15 and another for \\\\$17, they would only have two loyalty points. \n",
    "    - To help you check your results, the phone number `2726514133` should have 73 loyaty points adn the phone number `8702617860` should have 114.\n",
